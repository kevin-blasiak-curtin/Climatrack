## 🌦️ Your Weather Intelligence Platform

**Climatrack** is a world-class, AI-powered weather intelligence platform built with **Python** and **Streamlit**. It offers a rich, interactive user interface for accessing real-time global weather data, advanced analytics, and premium visualisations, moving beyond simple forecasts to provide deep, actionable insights.

---

### Vision: Beyond the Forecast, Towards True Insight

Standard weather apps provide data; Climatrack provides intelligence. In a world where weather patterns are increasingly volatile, access to simple forecasts is no longer enough. Individuals and businesses need to understand the *context* behind the numbers—the trends, the risks, and the potential impact on daily life and operations.

The vision for Climatrack is to bridge the gap between raw weather data and actionable intelligence. We believe that everyone deserves access to high-fidelity meteorological insights presented through an intuitive and beautiful interface. Climatrack is more than just a weather app; it's a sophisticated data analysis and visualization tool designed to empower decision-making.

## 🧩 Architecture & Modularity

The application is cleanly architected into distinct, single-responsibility modules, making it scalable and easy to maintain:
* `main.py`: The main application entry point. Contains the `PremiumWeatherApp` class which controls the UI and application flow.
* `weather_api.py`: The `PremiumWeatherAPI` class manages all communication with the OpenWeatherMap API, including advanced features like caching, rate limiting, and data validation.
* `location_detector.py`: The `PremiumLocationDetector` class handles all geocoding and IP-based location lookups, using AI-enhancements to improve accuracy.
* `data_processor.py`: The `AdvancedDataProcessor` class is the analytics engine. It takes raw API data and transforms it into the advanced trends, scores, and insights seen in the app.
* `ui_components.py`: The `UIComponents` class is a library of custom-styled HTML and CSS components, ensuring a consistent and premium look and feel across the application.
